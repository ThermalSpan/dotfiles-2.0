Dotfiles-2.0
###################

I wanted to give NeoVim a try, and took that as an opportunity to rebuild my vim setup. Currently, there I have not included a setup script. If you want to use these files, clone this repository then set up a symbolic links for nvimrc and the nvim directory.

```
ln -s nvimrc.DOTFILE ~/.nvimrc
ln -s nvrim.DOTDIR ~/.nvim
```
