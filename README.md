# Dotfiles-2.0

### What?
I wanted to give NeoVim a try, and took that as an opportunity to rebuild my vim setup. I'll also be adding other dotfiles as I see fit.

### Setup
Currently, there I have not included a setup script. If you want to use these files, clone this repository then set up a symbolic links for nvimrc and the nvim directory.

```
ln -s nvimrc.DOTFILE ~/.nvimrc
ln -s nvrim.DOTDIR ~/.nvim
``` 

### Programs

Currently, I have dotfiles for:
    * Neovim
    * GHCi
